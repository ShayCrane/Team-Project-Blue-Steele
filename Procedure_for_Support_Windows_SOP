# Procedure for Support and Administration of Windows Systems:
#### Support of Windows Systems
- All support for Windows Systems will be handled by using a ticketing system via Spice-Works.
- Users will submit a ticket via email to Blue Steeles email address.
- Blue Steele will receive the email and enter in the help desk ticket via Spice Work.
- The issue will be handled based on priority, as detailed in our SLA.
- If the issue requires Blue Steele to remote desktop a technician will reach out to the user to find a time that is suitable.
- If the issue requires a technician to be on-site we will reach out to the user to find a time that works.
- The ticket will be updated and tracked in Spice Works and when completed the ticket will be closed out.

#### Administration of Windows Systems
- If Administrative updates need to be done an email will be sent out to the company with the approved date and time.
- Users will be required to make sure their computers are on site and signed out of, but left on to receive the update.
- A second push will be scheduled to update the computers that could not attend the first push.
- After the second attempt an email will be sent to each user and team lead to determine the time to best update the computer. 
- Failure to update the computer will result in it being denied access to company resources until an update can be performed.
