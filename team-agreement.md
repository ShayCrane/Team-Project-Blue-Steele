# Blue Steele Team Agreement

**Team Members**:  
- Dean Weiss
- Emily Lee (Project Manager)
- Michael Rouson
- Shannon Crane

# **Cooperation Plan**
Every person on your team is an asset. 

What are the key strengths of each person on the team? 
- Emily: Background in coding and works well with people 
- Shannon: Prompt, reliable
- Dean: Technically proficient and organizing time 
- Michael: Work ethic

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project? 
- Emily: Build code and resolve conflicts efficiently
- Shannon: I can make sure we are staying on course per our plan and calendar
- Dean: Help others and be a second set of eyes on different parts of the project
- Michael: Work through challenges that are encountered during the project and have motivation to continue despite them 
  

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Emily: I would like to improve my craft competency.
- Shannon: craft, tools, results
- Dean: I would like to develop my Craft and push out a professional looking product.
- Michael: Teamwork and communication competencies (being able to delegate)  

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work? 
- Emily: Check in before and after work session 
- Shannon: I will ask others to slow down if I or another team mate needs to digest material, and when appropriate I will use my personal time to get up to speed in the event I need more time to digest material
- Dean: By having frequent meetings and checking in with one another.
- Michael: Break down the project into manageable tasks vs. overall big picture 

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

# **Conflict Plan**
Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- Elmo is our code name to focus on the task at hand. Check in at the beginning, mid, and end of the work session. 

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- Have a group discussion. Request help from Code Fellows Staff as a last resort. 

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- Consistent and efficient communication and help each other fill in gaps/educate.  Don’t be afraid to ask questions. 

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- First, we will set up a system of delegation.  If that is insufficient, then a one-on-one conversation with the person.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- Two unsuccessful attempts at changing behavior despite discussions
 
# **Communication Plan**
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

What hours will you be available to communicate? 
- 9AM-4PM; treat it like work 

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? 
- Slack and virtual campus 

How often will you take breaks? 
- Lunch break and as needed

What is your plan if you start to fall behind? 
- Ask teammates for help. In extreme cases, request help from Code Fellows Staff 

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? 
- Slack or virtual campus 

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? 
- During meetings, going around the "table" to get input from everyone

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? 
- Daily check-ins and just be cool :)

# **Work Plan** 
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
- During daily check-ins, start vs end 

What project management tool will be used?
- Trello 

# **Presentation Deck**
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.
Link to the shared doc in your project plan.
Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

> - Presentation date: Friday, August 19, 2022 
> - Rehearsal: Thurs, August 18, 2022 @ 1:00 p.m.
> - Standups: weekdays @ 9:45 a.m.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

What components of your project will live on GitHub?
- Project prep i.e. team agreement, script, important links 

How will you share the repository with your teammates?
- Added collaborators to repo

What is your Git flow?
- Create individual branches, add two person verification 
    - How many people must review a PR?
      - 2 Person PR
    - Who merges PRs? 
      - Main repo owner  
    - How often will you merge?
 	    - After important updates within individual branches - no limit.
	2 merges per day to main branch i.e. mid/end day 
    - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
      - When it’s been communicated that everyone is done with their task
